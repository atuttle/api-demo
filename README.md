# API Demo

This repo contains everything you need to do a CFML live-coding API demo, including a mysql database in a docker container (you're on your own to install Docker), and a `server.json` compatible with [CommandBox](https://commandbox.ortusbooks.com) to stand up a quick and dirty [Lucee](https://www.lucee.org) server instance.

Run `make up` to install and start the docker containers, install Taffy, and start a Lucee server.
